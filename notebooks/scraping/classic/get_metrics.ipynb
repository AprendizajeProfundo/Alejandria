Cutting-edge output quality, second only to our state-of-the-art model `FLUX.1 [pro]`.\\n2. Competitive prompt following, matching the performance of closed source alternatives .\\n3. Trained using guidance distillation, making `FLUX.1 [dev]` more efficient.\\n4. Open weights to drive new scientific research, and empower artists to develop innovative workflows.\\n5. Generated outputs can be used for personal, scientific, and commercial purposes as described in the [`FLUX.1 [dev]` Non-Commercial License](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev/blob/main/LICENSE.md).\\n\\n# Usage\\nWe provide a reference implementation of `FLUX.1 [dev]`, as well as sampling code, in a dedicated [github repository](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux).\\nDevelopers and creatives looking to build on top of `FLUX.1 [dev]` are encouraged to use this as a starting point.\\n\\n## API Endpoints\\nThe FLUX.1 models are also available via API from the following sources\\n- [bfl.ml](https://docs.bfl.ml/) (currently `FLUX.1 [pro]`)\\n- [replicate.com](https://replicate.com/collections/flux)\\n- [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/flux/dev)\\n- [mystic.ai](https://www.mystic.ai/black-forest-labs/flux1-dev)\\n\\n## ComfyUI\\n`FLUX.1 [dev]` is also available in [Comfy UI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) for local inference with a node-based workflow.\\n\\n## Diffusers\\n\\nTo use `FLUX.1 [dev]` with the ðŸ§¨ diffusers python library, first install or upgrade diffusers\\n\\n```shell\\npip install -U diffusers\\n```\\n\\nThen you can use `FluxPipeline` to run the model\\n\\n```python\\nimport torch\\nfrom diffusers import FluxPipeline\\n\\npipe = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained(\"black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)\\npipe.enable_model_cpu_offload() #save some VRAM by offloading the model to CPU.
