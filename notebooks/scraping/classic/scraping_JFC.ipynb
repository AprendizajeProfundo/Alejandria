Companies face challenges in maintaining security standards, particularly in managing varied and complex questionnaires from partners and regulators, which are time-consuming and repetitive for IT security teams. The primary issue addressed in this paper is enhancing consistency in responses to supply chain security questionnaires. These repetitive tasks drain resources and risk security compromises due to potential errors or omissions (Saenz et al. 2015). We propose a solution that automates the interpretation of these varied questionnaires, providing accurate, consistent answers based on predefined security protocols. RAG for Effective Supply Chain Security Questionnaire Automation \n",
      "Workshop on Information Technology and Systems, Bangkok, Thailand, 2024  2 Our research focuses on developing an application capable of parsing different document formats, understanding questionnaire contexts, and generating precise responses. We introduce a robust NLP model to recognize and interpret security-related inquiries, integrate this model into a user-friendly internal tool, and implement analytics to assess and refine response accuracy. Additionally, we develop automated testing frameworks to ensure the application's reliability and consistency over time. Related Works The development of automated form-filling systems has gained significant attention due to their potential to enhance efficiency and accuracy across industries. This section reviews recent advances, focusing on large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for automated questionnaire completion based on internal policies. Several studies have explored LLMs and RAG in different domains. Fuchs et al. (2021) introduced Form-BERT, a transformer-based model for auto-completing e-commerce forms by predicting attribute values, showcasing deep learning's specialized role in form automation. In contrast, Bucur (2023) integrated a knowledge base with an LLM for broader form completion tasks, emphasizing external knowledge sources to enhance accuracy, unlike Form-BERT’s more focused use case. Lewis et al. (2020) and Jeong (2023) examined integrating retrieval systems with LLMs to enhance response generation in knowledge-intensive tasks. Lewis et al. highlighted external data's role in informing LLM responses for handling diverse questionnaire formats, while Jeong focused on LangChain's use of internal business data to improve response accuracy. Both approaches demonstrate the importance of combining external knowledge with LLMs for better performance in complex tasks. RAG for Effective Supply Chain Security Questionnaire Automation \n",
      "Workshop on Information Technology and Systems, Bangkok, Thailand, 2024  3 Johnson et al. (2017) provided the FAISS library for efficient similarity searches in large datasets of embeddings, supporting the rapid retrieval of relevant policy information—critical for improving the accuracy and efficiency of large-scale data retrieval systems like ours. Recent works such as Atlas by Izacard et al. (2022) and a survey by Fan et al. (2024) emphasized the significance of RA-LLMs. Atlas showed retrieval-augmented models' effectiveness in few-shot learning, especially for knowledge-intensive tasks, without extensive parameters. Fan et al. offered a comprehensive overview of RA-LLMs, discussing their architectures, training strategies, and application areas, highlighting how integrating external knowledge helps overcome LLM limitations like hallucinations and outdated data. These studies emphasize the versatility of RAG with LLMs for handling complex and varied questionnaire formats. Our project builds on these methodologies, focusing on internal policies as the primary data source to streamline form-filling within organizations. Model Development Problem Statement The field of supply chain security requires extensive documentation and strict adherence to internal policies. IT security teams face the challenge of completing complex, time-consuming questionnaires that assess compliance with security policies and potential risks. These questionnaires, prone to human error and quality inconsistencies, are detailed and demanding. Our model leverages document embeddings and queries (q) stored in an Elasticsearch Vector Database (Elastic, 2023), guiding the retrieval function of an LLM model, which fetches the most relevant documents (D) for each query. The generative model then creates responses based on the retrieved documents. RAG for Effective Supply Chain Security Questionnaire Automation \n",
      "Workshop on Information Technology and Systems, Bangkok, Thailand, 2024  4 System Architecture and Workflow Our model, QuestSecure, automates questionnaire completion using a blend of algorithms and formulas to ensure accuracy and efficiency. Key components include the Input Module, which preprocesses documents and converts text into vector representations via LangChain tools (LangChain, 2023). These vectors are stored in an Elasticsearch-managed database for fast retrieval. The Retrieval Module identifies relevant documents, and the Response Generation Module, powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, generates accurate, natural responses based on retrieved content and the query. LangChain optimizes the workflow, from embedding generation to response generation, ensuring a streamlined process. This architecture maintains data integrity and relevance while facilitating smooth communication between modules. Interaction is enhanced through a Streamlit-based frontend (Streamlit, 2023), improving user experience and scalability. The system supports load balancing and distributed computing to handle growing data needs. Figure 1 outlines the system architecture, demonstrating how components work together to efficiently process queries and generate responses, improving IT security teams' efficiency while maintaining data privacy standards.

This collection includes German-language PDFs and Excel files with security protocols, guidelines, and questionnaires designed for IT security in various organizations. The dataset’s complexity, including tables, text, and images, is ideal for training our NLP model to handle security-related queries.

These embeddings are stored in Elasticsearch for quick retrieval in our Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, laying the groundwork for efficient responses to security questionnaire. Baseline Models To establish a robust baseline for our experiments, we employ PyPDFLoader (LangChain, 2023a) and CSVLoader (LangChain, 2023b) to accurately load PDF and CSV documents, ensuring they are correctly parsed and formatted for further processing. For document segmentation, we use RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (LangChain, 2023c) and CharacterTextSplitter (LangChain, 2023d), setting each chunk to 150 characters with zero overlap for comprehensive document coverage. In the embedding generation phase, we use the MiniLLM model from Nomic AI (2024), known for its efficient production of high-quality, semantically rich embeddings. For retrieval, we implemented a basic similarity search with k=20 to identify the top 20 documents matching the query's context. For response generation, we utilize the LlaMa 3 model, adept at generating instruction-based responses. This process, streamlined by a standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompt from LangChain's hub, allows us to create structured queries for accurate and relevant response generation. Post Processing In the post-processing phase, we refine model responses to ensure clarity and relevance. We remove repetitive elements and redundant phrases that do not contribute to a concise answer. Additionally, we filter out segments that stray from the question's language and context, RAG for Effective Supply Chain Security Questionnaire Automation \n",

This polishing ensures clear, contextually appropriate, and applicable responses, enhancing the system's effectiveness in handling supply chain security questionnaires. Experimental Setup  We experiment with chunk sizes from 150 to 512 characters and overlaps up to 100 to ensure the right balance between text granularity and contextual coherence. Different retrieval mechanisms, including similarity search and Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) (LangChain, 2023e), are tested to source the most contextually appropriate information. We vary the number of documents retrieved to refine our process further. Prompt engineering is key; we modify the location and details within the prompts to test how these changes affect the clarity and directness of responses. We experiment with different configurations and language-specific instructions to enhance output accuracy. Additionally, we use different models like LlaMa and Mistral Instruct to handle complex queries and generate context-aware answers. These experiments refine our approach and enhance our ability to automate responses to security questionnaires, establishing a robust framework that adapts to diverse document types and processing needs, thus improving our system’s efficacy. Evaluation Metrics We evaluate our proposed RAG-based approach using both semantic-based automatic metrics and human-like evaluation via an LLM. RAG for Effective Supply Chain Security Questionnaire Automation \n",
      "Workshop on Information Technology and Systems, Bangkok, Thailand, 2024  8 Semantic-Based Automatic Metrics: We employ BertScore (Zhang et al., 2020) and METEOR (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005) for their effectiveness in capturing the semantic richness of responses. BertScore utilizes BERT's contextual embeddings to provide precision, recall, and F1 scores, assessing text similarity between generated and reference responses. METEOR enhances n-gram overlap methods by considering alignment and linguistic nuances like synonyms and paraphrasing, offering a comprehensive measure of linguistic richness. G-Eval with EM German Mistral Model: Complementing automatic metrics, G-Eval (Liu et al., 2023) applies a powerful LLM, the EM German Mistral Model, to score responses on Context Precision, Context Recall, Faithfulness, and Answer Relevancy. These metrics evaluate the accuracy, coverage, truthfulness, and relevance of the responses, ensuring they align closely with the contextual demands of the queries. By integrating G-Eval, we incorporate a human-like perspective into our evaluation, addressing nuances potentially overlooked by automated metrics. This dual approach provides a thorough assessment of the RAG model, ensuring responses are not only accurate but contextually apt and linguistically coherent. Results We evaluate the performance of our proposed approach and all the baseline models. Figure 2 shows the results of different model configurations, and the percentage of valid responses returned. We use these results to determine which prompting technique is the most suitable. The configurations can be interpreted as given in Table 1.

Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) proved particularly effective in tasks requiring precise differentiation between similar documents, demonstrating its strength in high-precision contexts. Larger chunk sizes also improved performance by capturing more contextual information, leading to higher METEOR and BertScore (Recall) metrics due to enhanced semantic richness and better query alignment. The Llama model outperformed Mistral Instruct, likely due to its extensive training on diverse datasets, allowing it to better handle the complexity of security-related queries. G-Eval metrics provided a nuanced view of model performance, assessing contextual precision, recall, faithfulness, and relevancy of responses. While the basic configuration scored well, QuestSecure (SLOB) showed notable improvements across all G-Eval metrics. Further testing with more resources could provide deeper insights into other configurations. Conclusion Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks in automating responses to supply chain security questionnaires, significantly enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Simplified prompts, advanced retrieval techniques like MMR, and larger data chunk sizes have collectively contributed to improved response quality. The Llama model has shown exceptional performance due to its comprehensive training on diverse datasets. This reduces the burden on IT security teams and minimizes error potential, thereby improving compliance and security standards.

      "Workshop on Information Technology and Systems, Bangkok, Thailand, 2024  12 human-like evaluation metrics such as the G-Eval ensures that the automated responses align with nuanced human judgment, essential for maintaining response reliability in security settings. Limitations and Future Work Our study faced several limitations that affected the depth of our experimentation. Resource constraints limited our ability to test a wider range of model configurations, potentially missing insights into optimal settings. We also lacked access to more advanced LLMs, such as GPT-4 from Azure OpenAI, which restricted our ability to fully exploit the latest NLP advancements. Enhanced access to these models could significantly improve the accuracy and contextual relevance of the automated responses. Looking ahead, future work could focus on integrating more advanced LLMs to further refine response quality, benefiting from the latest AI and machine learning advancements. With increased computational resources, we could also explore more thorough hyperparameter tuning, optimizing factors like chunk size and document retrieval through methods like random search.
